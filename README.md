# icub-model-generator

Resources and programs to generated models (URDF,SDF) of the iCub robot. 

There are currently two different pipelines to generated the models. 

The old generation system (v1) based on data on robot models hardcoded in the iKin/iDyn source code and meshes postprocessed by ISIR at UPMC, Paris, available in `v1` directory.

The new generation system (v2) from actual CAD models converted to simmechanics file, described in http://wiki.icub.org/wiki/Creo_Mechanism_to_URDF , available in the `v2` directory.
