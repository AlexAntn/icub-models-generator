iCubModelGenerator
==================

Resources and programs to generated models (URDF,SDF) of the iCub robot

This folder should contain models of iCub - for example descriptions in the standard URDF format.

The folder urdf_paris contains the urdf models created at UPMC - ISIR by Joseph Salini ( https://github.com/XDE-ISIR/XDE-Resources ).

The folder urdf_idyn contains the urdf models extracted from the iDyn library, and the code necessary to create them.

The folder urdf_utils contains the programs used to generated the models combining meshes, limits and parameters into one urdf file.
